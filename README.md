Run it and your computer bluescreens. That's it. No admin permissions needed, either.

## Compiling

It's a single C file. Just use `clang bluescreen.c -o bluescreen.exe`, or whatever the MSVC equivalent is.  
There's also pre-compiled binaries for x86, x86-64, and ARM64 in the releases.

## Disclaimer

I am not responsible for whatever dumb crap you do with this.  
Please don't be stupid and put it in your startup folder, and please don't put it in someone else's startup folder either. In fact, just keep it away from *any* sort of startup or autorun folders.
